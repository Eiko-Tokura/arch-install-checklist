# arch-install-checklist

This is a detailed installation checklist that I wrote and used.

The main checklist is 'Arch-Install-CN.md', which should be useful for most people! owo

It also includes some of my config files (xmonad etc) and useful scripts for me mostly, but might be useful for you as well!
